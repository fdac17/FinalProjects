How do political donations affect policy decisions? Opensecrets.org provides a list of donations made to US politicians and the policies they have sponsored, co-sponsored or signed. I want to do a text analysis comparing the donating groups by field of interest to policies that relate to the regulation of that field, to see if there is a relationship between the policy and the donations.
