### Startup Analytics Idea

* Every year there are myriad new startups launched. These span numerous industries, with a greater number failing than suceeding.
* This project will analyze startup data such as industry, location, and other parameters to see if there is any correlation between these factors and success.
* The crunchbase API will be used to obtain necessary data.
