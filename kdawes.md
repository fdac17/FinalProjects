I will be investigating Gymnastic outcomes.  Using gymnastic competition score to determine base hierarchical structure of top gymnast. Then some correlation and analysis on this heighearctical structure based on gyms rank, age, age based on level, years in each level. Is there a way to predict early on if a gymnast is more likely to get injury or take injury time off , if so what age and what is its relation to score? As well as we can as a few more questions.
