### Reddit social interactions analysis

We plan to scrape reddit posts and comments and analysis user interactions with each other and posts. 
Perhaps we can identify elements which generate a lot of activity in the form of upvotes and downvotes. 
We also plan to identify themes and how they might evolve over time. 

Tools:

* [Reddit API](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API)
* [The Python Reddit API Wrapper](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Issues: 
* subreddits to scrape
* time limit to scrape
