Project Idea: Media Vs. Social media correlation pattern discovery

I want to use text analysis to attempt to look for correlations and possible perceivable patterns in relation to the prominent Ideas and 
themes expressed in Main Stream and Independent news sources and what the prominent themes and Ideas trending across social media across 
a predefined time frame (say a few months).I would like to see if the ideas/thems follow social media or vice versa, as well as look for 
differences in major stories that can be noticed through time, and maybe see how well the different news sources stay neutral or who ends
up closer to the truth overall.
