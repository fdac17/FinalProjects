# Possible Project Idea

## Analyze data from libraries.io using TDA
Question: Using topological data analysis software, can one determine a way of classifying similar structures of open source software?

What: [Topological data analytics](https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2013/lesnick-topological-data-analysis) is a new field of data analytics which attempts to understand the underlying space that data comes from. It can capitalize from data sources in the form of point clouds or networks to form simplicial complexes. This form of data analytics has been popular in the study of brainwave data. Specifically there is research where the analysis is used on hypocampal brainwave data of lab mice to determine where the mouse is located within an arena.

How: Possibly relying on the network structure of open source dependencies, we could create simplicial complexes using something like the "nearest-neighbor" filtration. With this new encoding of the data, we can use available software to find the zigzag persistant homology of the system.
